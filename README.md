## Project 8 - Three.js

The goal of the project is to create an art gallery museum scene using Three.js.
Your scene content will be about art gallery museum, and your scene must include at least the
following technical elements:

- Includes at least 8 objects (sculptures, drawings tables.. etc), some of which are
hierarchically related.
- Uses at least three types of geometry (cubes, spheres, planes, extrusions, etc.), at least two
of which is a model loaded from an OBJ file.
- Has multiple lights.
- Has a skybox.
- Uses texture mapping on something other than the skybox.
- Has controls for the camera (here you can just copy the keyboard handler from the example
files). Your camera will visit the art gallery museum around the objects.
- Has at least three features that are animated.
- Uses shader effects on at least one object. The shaders should be different from the examples
that we have covered, e.g. bump mapping, shading, etc. You are free to obtain sample
shaders or create your own by using online repositories, e.g. https://shaderfrog.com. 

> [!TIP]
> For learning more interactive, you can see Three.js tutorial [here](https:/threejs.org/) which give you many interactive examples [here](https://threejs.org/examples/).

You will create a scene that conceptâ€™s art gallery museum and there will be some objects according to art gallery museum concept.
